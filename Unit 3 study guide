Unit 3: Functions and Classes


Important vocab:
parameter/argument - a variable that is passed into the parantheses in a function
return - functions sometimes return something. The return value can be any type of variable, and can be set as equal to a value, used in a conditional, etc.
calling a function - using a function (ex. max(a, b, c), fizzbuzz(100))




Function
A function stores a segment of code so that it can be used multiple times by calling the function instead of having to write out the code everytime you want to perform that task
