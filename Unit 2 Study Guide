Unit 2: If Statements and loops


Important vocab:




If statements:
checks a conditional statement and if it returns true, then it executes some code
conditional statements can use many different operators
Here is a more comprehensive list of all the operators: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp

syntax:
if some condition:
  execute some code
  
examples:
# This example uses the greater than comparison operator
if (x + 3) > (y / 5):
  print("x is 3 greater than y divided by 5")

# This example uses the 'and' logical operator
if a >= 5 and a <= 10:
  print("a is greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10")

# This example uses the 'in' membership operator
fruit = "Apple"
if 'a' in fruit or x % 3 == 0:
  print("either the letter a is in the string fruit, or x is divisible by 3")
  

Elif and Else statements
if an if statement is evaluated as false, then python will go on to check any elif or else statements that follow
elif: if the preceding if statement is false, then it will check another condition
else: if the preceding if statement is false, then it will execute the code

syntax:
if some condition:
  execute some code
elif some other condition:
  execute some code
else:
  execute some code
  
example:
a = 4
b = 17
c = 13

if a >= b and a >= c:
  print("a is the greatest number")
elif b >= c:
  print("b is the greatest number")
else:
  print("c is the greatest number")

fav_animal = 'Beluga'
zoo_animals = ['Lion', 'Hippopotamus', 'Giraffe', 'Tiger']

if fav_animal in zoo_animals:
  print("This zoo has my favorite animal!")
else:
  print("This zoo doesn't have my favorite animal );")



grade = 72

# notice how in this example the else statement could be replaced with another elif statement. Both ways are fine, but it is best to use 
if grade < 70:
  print("See me after class >:(")
elif grade >= 70 and grade > 80:
  print("You passed, but you should probably study more :/")
elif grade >= 80 and grade < 90:
  print("Not bad :P. Go for an A next time!")
else:
  print("AMAZING :DDDDD")
