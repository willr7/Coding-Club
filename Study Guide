Unit 1: Variables

Topics: Integers, Strings, Lists, Booleans

Vocab:
initialize - set the value of a variable (e.g. x = 5, day = "Thursday", sussy = True)
conditional statements (conditionals) - statement that is evaluated as true or false
operators - special symbols that indicate some sort of computation. Five main types: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, and Membership (don't worry about remembering all of these)
assignment operator - used to assign a value to a variable (e.g. '=', '+=', '-=')
arithmetic operators - used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations (e.g. '+', '-', '*', '%')
comparison operators - used to compare two values (e.g. '==', '!=', '>', '<=')
logical operators - used to combine conditional statements ('and', 'or', 'not')
membership operators - used to check if something is in a list ('in', 'not in')
concatenation - adding two strings (see line 41)
method - a function that is available because of an objects type (upper(), lower(), append()) (see line 51)
index - the position of an element in a list
syntax - writing code so that it can be correctly interpreted by your computer



Integers
Any non fraction (5, 40, -29)

how to initialize:
# stores the value 5 in the variable x
x = 5
# the same as x = x + 10
x += 10
# returns the remainder of x / 3
y = x % 3


Strings
letters or symbols enclosed by quotation marks ("Dune", "Sandwich!", "Let's go to the park")

how to initialize:
generic_greeting = "Hello, how are you?"
# can be added and multiplied like integers
# this prints "Hello, how are you? I've been better", try it yourself :D
print(generic_greeting + " I've been better")
generic_response = "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
# This prints "¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯", try it yourself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
print(generic_response * 5)

How to concatenate:
# the "\n" starts a new line, try it yourself :))))
small_talk = generic_greeting + "\n" + generic_response
name = "shaqiqi"
print("My name is " + name)

Misc info:
# This will print "Coding club is so much fun"
real_club_review = "codINg CluB iS sO mUcH FUn"
print(real_club_review.capitalize())
# This will print "CODING CLUB IS SO MUCH FUN!"
print(real_club_review.upper())
# you can think of a string as a list of characters (see the lists section for more information)
# this means you can access certain elements of a string
print(name[4])
print(real_club_review[:5])


Lists
an ordered, changeable collection of variables called 'elements' ([4, 6, 10], ["How's it going", "What's up", "What's poppin"], [["One", "Two", "Three"], [1, 2, 3], ["1", "10", "11"]])

How to initialize:
fruits = ["Durian", "Rambutan", "Lychee"]
fav_numbers = [28, 4, 3]

Lists are ordered by index. The first element in a list is at index 0.
The index is used to access elements from a list
print(fruits[0])

Splits
You can access multiple elements from a list by using a split
syntax: fruits[0:2] accesses the first two elements (the first number is inclusive, the second number is exclusive)
fruits[1:3] accesses the last two elements (notice how the second number is 3, but the index of the last element is 2)
fruits[:2] is the same as fruits[0:2] (it assumes that you are starting at 0)
fruits[1:] is the same as fruits[1:3] (it assumes that you want to access every element from 1 to the end of the list)
examples (try it yourself :O):
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
print("The first three vowels are: " + vowels[:3])
print("The last three vowels are: " + vowels[2:])
print("The middle three vowels are: " + vowels[1:4])
